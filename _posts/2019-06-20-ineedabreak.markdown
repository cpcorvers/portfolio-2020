The elective Experiential Design Landscapes (EDL) further developed my understanding and skills in design-research methods to innovate in near-realtime environments with multiple stakeholders. Next to learning and practicing the EDL method I spend a great time on the creation of interactive digital prototypes. First within the Google forms, sites and sheets and later with NodeJS, MySQL and JSON.

I experienced to put the EDL method into practice in a project and in the real-life environment, learned to create an application in NodeJS and with the Google Cloud Platform, and got some experience working with databases like mySQL and JSON.

There was a positive flow of collaboration during the project with the whole team where all memebers could participate and contribute within their strength and desired learning objectives.This resulted in a new experience and improved understanding in the EDL method within a real-life environment in collaboration with other designers. It also improved the humanistic mindset and systemic approach of myself as a designer and enriched my toolbox to create valuable and meaningful interaction between people within a co-operating ecosystem.

I need a break had a big exposure through Cursor and the experiments in the Auditorium lecture halls. Discussion arouse where different aspects of the design including some ethical consequences by professors from other departments. Quit an achievement for a assignment during an elective on a design-method. It really showed the power of EDL and a collaborative team.

The acquired skills on coding with NodeJS in html, css and javascript is used later on in my projects.
