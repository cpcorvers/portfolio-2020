Struckture was developed during a study group assignment in the elective From Idea to Design.

An independent living elderly person with dementia often forget scheduled appointments. Struckture is an interactive design on which a person can schedule their own day from their agenda. The person stays in control and Struckture helps the person to be reminded on their appointments.

In this first elective on design-methods and design-tools I learned the Reflective Transformative Design Process, generating Ideas, Values and Concepts and physicalize these in different ways.

The result is an understanding in the use and power of RTDP and sketching and prototyping in the design of an idea.â€¨  I also worked on my skills in reflecting, sketching and prototyping by creating the poster and form and technical prototypes for the concept of Struckture, skills which I used later on in my projects as well.
