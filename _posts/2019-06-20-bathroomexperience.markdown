In this elective officially named "Corporate entrepreneurship and innovation" two guest teachers from Philips gave insight into their value proposition and co-creation model (VPC) through electives and group assignment in which we followed the model step-by-step each week.

I learned the VPC-model, generating Ideas, Values and Concepts and physicalize these in different ways. I also learned from my fellow students different visualizing technics for ideas, concepts and insights to a broader audience.

Although VPC doesnâ€™t differ that much from RTDP it is a more business orientated design process which gave me new insights into design processes. VPC is more outcome oriented on three objectives, customer relevance, technology feasibility and business viability. The team was divided into these three objectives which gave some useful friction. It also forces the design thinking towards reachable value proposition.

During an user interview I experienced that abstract and tangible artefacts became effective communication tools for co-creation. Also the priorities of the user changed when the question changed from what they desire to what they want to pay for. This learned me a lot about weighting user data and the strength of abstract artefacts which I used later on in my projects.
