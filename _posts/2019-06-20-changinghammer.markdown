 Part of the elective "Societal Challenge" was the creation of an infographic and video of the article "Changing your hammer" (Gardien, Djajadiningrat, Hummels, & Brombacher, 2014). This enriched my view on craftmanship and the development as a professional working to master design methods and design tools. Through this excercise I learned skills in creating video, recoring audio and making an infographic within Adobe Illustrator some of which I used later on in my projects.
