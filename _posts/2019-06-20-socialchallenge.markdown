The municipality Altena was planned to be established on 1 January 2019. In the upcoming years the citizens participated in several projects which came together in Altena's Living lab but the collaboration between the different actors did not have the desired effects. During the elective we were challenged to support Altena in the creation of a good functioning Living Lab in which projects and ideas of the actors in Altena can grow to a successful realization?

From our believe that every involved person can have a meaningful contribution to Altena regardless their role or background, we designed a setup where participants in the role of citizen, civil servant or councilor brainstorm on ideas for a presented challenge. These challenges were visualized on a table, the ideas were written down on a table cover and could serve as inspiration. In time restricted rounds of brainstorming the participants work on several challenges.

### Changing your hammer
Part of this elective was the creation of an infographic and video of the article "Changing your hammer" (Gardien, Djajadiningrat, Hummels, & Brombacher, 2014).

### Reflection
This elective was aimed at acquiring knowledge of and skills on the latest academic and pragmatic views of the Transformation Paradigm and related field within the context of a real social challenge. With the exhibition and gatherings in the Design-house and by executing a project with  Fontys and TU/e students for the municipality Altena I learned to apply the DRIVing framework for Transformative Practices and experience to work with a real-time social challenge on the implementation of a Living Lab.

On design competences I found my strength –understanding complex environments, hopping between perspectives and rapidly creating lo-fi prototypes, concepts and an exhibition stand– and pitfalls –hi-fi aesthetic prototyping, group work and communication of thoughts. I also learned to express in artistic ways like embodiment, prototyping and reporting.

The future municipality Altena is working on a space where co-creation shapes initiatives of the citizens. This is not simple as there are many opinions ad ideals. Besides the governance responsibility, bureaucratic procedures and citizens interests. The role of the councler (decision maker), civil servant and citizen meet each other in the LivingLab Altena from a common interest to work on a strong Altena.
