    Hi, my name is Peter!
    <br>
    You can put different labels on my profession. I prefer to be non-conformistic on these labels and call myself first of all 'Human' and describe my professional live as a quest towards craftsmenship.
  </p>
  <p>&emsp;</p>
  <p>
    Craftsmenship is all about the dedicated and engaged professional who masters tools and techniques for the sake of the work on its own (Sennet, 2008).
  </p>
  <p>&emsp;</p>
  <p>
    For this moment I frame my intended craftmenship the 'Creative director'. A combination of the
    qualities of a transformative leader, systemic designer and servant of justice within the context of a public sector organisation.
  </p>
  <p>&emsp;</p>
  <p>
    Through my company De Vakmakerij, my military profession and my voluntarily endeavors, I aim to seduce individuals and organisations towards a morally right transformation and empower them with techniques and tools.
  </p>
  <p>Moral right actions take into account individual and organisational rights, duties, interest and wishes in order to satisfy the needs of all involved others (Ekins & Max-Neef, 1996; Governance and Integrity, 2008; Gerritsen, 2011).
  </p>
  <p>&emsp;</p>
  <p>
    With the creation of tools and techniques I facilitate the design of beautiful and understandable services and (organisational) systems in the context of wicked problems within public sector organisations. The tools and techniques facilitate the
    translation of thoughts, ideas and concepts so users, providers, facilitators and producers to become change, work on change and realise transformation (Hummels, Trotto, LÃ©vy, Peeters, Alves Lino & Klooster, 2018).
  </p>
