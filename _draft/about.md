Hi, my name is Peter!
<br>
You can put different labels on my profession. I prefer to be non-conformistic on these labels and call myself first of all 'Human' and describe my professional live as a quest towards craftsmenship. Craftsmenship is all about the dedicated and engaged professional who masters tools and techniques for the sake of the work on its own (Sennet, 2008). For this moment I frame my intended craftmenship the 'Creative director'. A combination of the qualities of a transformative leader, systemic designer and servant of justice within the context of a public sector organisation.
<br><br>
Through my company De Vakmakerij, my military profession and my voluntarily endeavors, I aim to seduce individuals and organisations towards a morally right transformation and empower them with techniques and tools. Moral right actions take into account individual and organisational rights, duties, interest and wishes in order to satisfy the needs of all involved others (Ekins & Max-Neef, 1996; Governance and Integrity, 2008; Gerritsen, 2011).
<br><br>
With the creation of tools and techniques I facilitate the design of beautiful and understandable services and (organisational) systems in the context of wicked problems within public sector organisations. The tools and techniques facilitate the  gimtranslation of thoughts, ideas and concepts so users, providers, facilitators and producers to become change, work on change and realise transformation (Hummels, Trotto, LÃ©vy, Peeters, Alves Lino & Klooster, 2018).

Personal strength and individual freedom are central in my devel- opment. Utilise my talents, discover my professional identity and become master in my craft.

Leadership was developed at the RNLDA and practiced as com- mander and branch chief. The dynamics, strength and elements of a multi-actor network was developed within the Post academic study KEtenregie and practiced as staff officer of the Miltiary Engineers Centre of Expertise. The art, science and skills of a Designer were developed at Eindhoven University of Technology and practices as staff officer and innovator within the branch Knowledge and Development of the Royal Netherlands Army. I am a master in my craft but can improve on effectiveness in collaboration with others.

My craftmenship is primarily executed within the military context. A tailor made designproces and supporting tools were co-created, tested and implemented in de Royal Netherlands Army. A design mindset was taught to team members and colleagues through teaching and coaching. Thereby inspiring individuals and organi- sations to create meaning and value in people's life.
