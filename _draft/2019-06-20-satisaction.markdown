How can a design concept support professionals to explore, visualise and facilitate value creation in a multi-stakeholder setting?

<!-- In this project we want to develop a tool and method which can function as an asset for governmental and other stakeholders to explore and develop transformation. -->

<!-- This design project started with the objective to create a method and tools to improve and understand the interaction within the transformation paradigm (Brand and Rocchi 2011) and transformative practices (Hummels, Trotto, Lévy, Peeters, Lino Alves & Klooster, 2018). -->

<!-- Literature study, conversations with professionals and practitioners and experimenting with designed tools in workshops created insights and inspiration to support the interaction of professionals working on complex issues in society. -->

<!-- Tangible tools really make a difference in the conversations on these issues. The artefacts and embodiment of stakeholders created a common understanding by participants during workshops. Participants very quickly started talking about the content instead of the context, they became more sensitive towards each other and the topic. Through these insights the method Satis-action was created. -->

<!-- According to Weick (1995), any map or strategic plan will work when an organisation is lost, because it will give an orientation for people to follow. Once on the move the cues along the path will guide the way. This brought me to the research topic: -->
"Once people begin to act, they generate tangible outcomes in some context and this helps them discover what is occurring, what needs to be explained and what should be done next" (Weick, 1995 p. 55).

This text describes the intended meaning of the Satis-action method through which participants start acting together and generate tangible outcomes and a tangible context of the specific case or project they are working in. By doing so, they discover the ongoing situation (awareness), start explaining their professional interpretation of the problem and the actions they can undertake, to each other (understanding) and thereby identify possible next steps to come to a comprehensive solution.

Satis-action is an interaction method which endeavors the environment and dynamics of people, communities and organisations in a specific case around humans. The System Constellation Play is a communication tool of artefacts like pawns of a board game, to make the central figures and characters of this environment visual and tangible.
<!-- With the setup of the environment, the professionals can work towards a more balanced and sustainable situation. -->

<!-- ### The Satis-action Play -->
<!-- Central figures represent the individual with a problem or need of the specific case at hand. The central figures are set in the middle of the attention. The persons, groups, communities or organisations in the environment of the central figures are called characters. The characters are represented by professionals (not on the pictures for privacy and security reasons). The last representation is the satisfier which are contributions by a character to solve the issues of the central figure. Satisfiers come in all kind of forms like products, services, capital, information or social engagements (Ekins & Max-Neef, 1992). -->

The technique of Satis-action and the tool System Constellation Play support professionals in their endeavor to fullfill their duties and the needs and wishes of an individual or organisation within its complex systemic environment.

<!-- Satis-action with the accompanied System Constellation Play XL tool was re-designed to do empirical research on the method with the use of the qualitative research methodology intuitive inquiry. This inquiry is executed in two different environments of collaborating organisations during worksessions with the involved professionals. -->

<!-- The System Constellation Play XL is a communication tool to make the central figures and characters tangible and sensible. The tool uses large artefacts like pawns of a board game to visualize the central figures, characters and satisfiers. -->

<img src="/assets/images/satisaction-design-thumbnail.png" class="case-image" alt="">
<!-- Satis-action uses a story-theater discourse as an understandable process for the participants who will structure the environment around the central figure with the use of the System Constellation Play XL and start an interactive dialogue on the dynamics in the system. These activities are referred to as the Play –like the collection of scenes in a theater. The guided Play has four acts. -->
<!-- 1- Introduction of the central figure
2- Setup of the constellation
3- Dialogue
4- Closing act. -->

<!-- The Play is guided by a moderator and recorded with video and/or picture cameras. From these records important snapshot are visualized on an abstract overview. Besides this storyline, the outcome of the Play are a common picture on the problem case and a prioritized set of actions or interventions for the participants. -->

<!-- ### Findings -->
<!-- When professionals setup the scenery and performing in a dialogue, they generate the awareness and activities within the system constellation and this helps them to discover what is the situation of the central figure, what are the dynamics around the central figure, what needs to be explained to other characters and what should be done to improve the need of the central figure in a sustainable manner. -->
