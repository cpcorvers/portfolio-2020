Craftsmenship is all about the dedicated and engaged professional who masters tools and techniques for the sake of the work on its own (Sennet, 2008). This portfolio-layout is crafted along the qualities to give a glance of my intended craftmenship. The expertise areas of the study are interwoven as well.

Craftsmenship is all about the dedicated and engaged profession- al who masters tools and techniques for the sake of the work on its own (Sennet, 2008). I framed my intended craftmenship the Cre- ative director. A combination of the qualities of a transformative leader, systemic designer and servant of justice within the context of a public sector organisation.

Through my company De Vakmakerij and my military profession, I aim to seduce individuals and organisations towards a morally right transformation and empower them with techniques and tools to take into account individual and organisational rights, du- ties, interest and wishes in order to satisfy the needs of all involved others (Ekins & Max-Neef, 1996; Governance and Integrity, 2008; Gerritsen, 2011). I embrace complexity and use it to support the design of beautiful and understandable services and (organisa- tional) systems in the context of wicked problems within public sector organisations. I support the translation of thoughts, ideas and concepts so users, providers, facilitators and producers be- come change, work on change and realise transformation (Hum- mels, Trotto, LÃ©vy, Peeters, Alves Lino & Klooster, 2018).
