###### System Constellation Play XL

Crafstmen reshape reality with tools and techniques and reshape tools as well. During the masterstudy I created three tools to reshape reality, the System Constellation Play Small, System Constellation Play XL and the Perception board. While designed during respectively M1.1, M1.2 and FMP projects they also benefit other purposes. The System Constellation Play XL is used for User-journeys and Showcases during workshops and System Constellation Play Small is used by process directors at the Veiligheidshuis in meetings with clients.

###### System Constellation Play Small

The Perception board created during the FMP is observed by visitors of the Demoday for different applications as well. The tools are abstract forms of characters and 'low-res' designed so they invite participants to customize them to their perspective.
